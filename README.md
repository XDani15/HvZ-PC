# HvZ-PC
Humans vs. Zombies game written for PC. When compiling you must include glut.h and glut32.dll. You can also compile it with resolution parameters


When creating this, it would not let me upload the dll that is needed to run this code. You can find the dll online, it's pretty simple. Here is a link I have found for it: http://mycodelog.com/2010/05/15/gllibs/

The dll you are looking for is glut32.dll.

Happy Gaming!
